# gota

Gota, an API for recipes powered by AWS and FastAPI.

## Components

-   gota-cdk: infrastructure management and deployment.
-   gota-core: core library which implements an api to create, read and update recipes.

## Run Locally

There are two ways to run the api locally: via a ASGI web service or an emulated aws environment.

### ASGI Web Service

Go to gota-core and check the `Testing > Integration` section in its README.md file.

### Emulated aws environment

Coming soon...
